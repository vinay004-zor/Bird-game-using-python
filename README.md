Flappy Bird Clone in Ursina Engine
This project is a simple Flappy Bird clone developed using the Ursina game engine in Python. The game features a bird that the player can control to navigate through a series of pipes by pressing the space bar. The bird falls due to gravity, and the game ends if the bird collides with any pipes or falls out of the screen.

Features
Sky Background: A static sky background for visual appeal.
Animated Bird: A bird entity with an animation that responds to player input.
Pipes: Continuously spawning pipes that the bird must navigate through.
Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions between the bird and the pipes, or if the bird falls below the screen, which ends the game.

Project Structure
main.py: The main script containing the game logic.
assets/: Directory containing image assets for the bird and sky.
img/: Animation frames for the bird.
img2/: Background image for the sky.

How It Works
Bird Movement: The bird's vertical position is updated continuously, and pressing the space bar makes the bird ascend.
Pipes: New pipes are generated at regular intervals with randomized vertical positions to create the challenge.
Collision Detection: The game checks if the bird intersects with any pipes or falls below the screen to determine if the game should end.

Future Improvements
Add sound effects for flapping and collisions.
Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's progress.
Enhance the visual elements with more detailed graphics and animations.
